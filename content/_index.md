Welcome. I am a researcher specializing in **spatial analytics and geospatial science**, with a focus on [your research areas — e.g., urban spatial patterns, remote sensing, GIS modeling]. I use geographic information systems, spatial statistics, and computational methods to understand how space and place shape the world around us.

On this site you will find my research articles, occasional opinion pieces on geospatial topics, and my academic CV.
