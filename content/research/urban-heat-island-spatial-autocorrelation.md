## Abstract

Urban heat islands (UHI) represent one of the most well-documented consequences of urbanization, yet their spatial distribution and clustering patterns remain incompletely understood at the intra-urban scale. This study examines spatial autocorrelation patterns in UHI effects across 12 major metropolitan areas using Moran's I statistic and local indicators of spatial association (LISA).

## Introduction

The uneven distribution of thermal environments within cities has significant implications for public health, energy consumption, and urban planning. While the aggregate UHI effect — the tendency of urban cores to be warmer than surrounding rural areas — is well established, spatial heterogeneity within urban areas is less studied.

This paper addresses the following research questions:

1. To what extent do UHI intensities exhibit spatial clustering within metropolitan areas?
2. Which urban morphological characteristics are most strongly associated with local thermal anomalies?
3. How do these patterns vary across cities with different climates and development patterns?

## Methods

We obtained land surface temperature (LST) data from Landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) imagery for 12 cities during summer months (June–August) from 2018 to 2023. All images were acquired under clear-sky conditions with cloud cover below 10%.

Spatial autocorrelation was assessed using global Moran's I and local Getis-Ord G* statistics at a 100-meter grid resolution.

## Results

Global Moran's I values ranged from 0.42 to 0.78 across the study cities, indicating moderate to strong positive spatial autocorrelation in all cases. Hot spot analysis revealed consistent clustering of high-temperature zones in areas characterized by high impervious surface cover and low vegetation density.

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates that UHI intensity is not randomly distributed within cities but exhibits significant spatial clustering linked to land cover composition. These findings have direct implications for targeted urban greening strategies and equitable urban planning.
