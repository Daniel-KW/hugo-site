title: "Why Every Policymaker Needs to Think Spatially"

summary: "Policies that ignore geography often fail not because of bad intentions, but because they treat place as irrelevant. Spatial literacy is not a technical luxury — it is a governance necessity."

There is a quiet assumption embedded in much of modern policymaking: that a good policy applies equally everywhere. Fund the program, set the rules, measure the outcome. Geography, in this view, is just a delivery mechanism — not a variable that fundamentally shapes what works.

This assumption is wrong, and the consequences are measurable.

## Place Is Not Neutral

When a public health intervention is designed at the national level and applied uniformly, it will systematically underperform in places where the underlying spatial conditions differ from the assumed norm. A smoking cessation program designed around urban clinic access will fail in rural areas. An infrastructure investment formula blind to spatial connectivity will miss the communities most isolated.

Spatial autocorrelation — the tendency of nearby places to be more similar to each other than to distant ones — means that problems cluster. Poverty clusters. Disease clusters. Pollution clusters. Interventions that ignore this clustering waste resources by spreading them uniformly across space when concentration would be more effective.

## What Spatial Thinking Offers

Geospatial analysis is not simply about making maps. It is about understanding the relational structure of the world — who is near whom, what flows between places, where barriers exist, and how context shapes outcomes.

Modern spatial analytics tools allow policymakers to:

- Identify which communities are genuinely underserved relative to need, not just absolute numbers
- Model how interventions will propagate through spatial networks
- Detect unintended geographic consequences of policies before implementation

## The Open Data Imperative

Much of this potential depends on the availability of spatially referenced public data. The geospatial data revolution of the past decade — satellite imagery, GPS traces, open government datasets — has created an extraordinary opportunity. But this data is unevenly accessible, often siloed in government systems, and rarely integrated in ways that support spatial policy analysis.

Advocating for open, interoperable, spatially referenced government data is not a technical argument. It is a governance argument. Spatial data is public infrastructure.

## A Call to Spatial Literacy

I am not suggesting that every policymaker become a GIS analyst. But I am suggesting that the most consequential policy failures of our time — in housing, in health, in climate adaptation — have a spatial dimension that is routinely overlooked.

Thinking spatially means asking: *where* does this problem occur, *why* there, and *what* does proximity and connectivity have to do with it? These are not exotic questions. They are foundational ones.
